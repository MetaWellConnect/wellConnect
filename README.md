- Story:  Mediscan is a web-based tool that empowers patients to visually verify their medications after a doctor's visit. It also sends patients updates and reminders regarding when to take their medication and which medication to take to help prevent medical errors when taking medication.
- Market: Patients  seeking to reduce medical errors, visually impaired, low literacy individuals, and physicians following up post medical visit
- Habit: This web app is meant to be used daily as it helps patients keep track of daily medications that they must take.
- Scope: The scope of the project includes patients being able to register medications for verification by their doctor and by using OCR to read the label, sending notifications to remind the patient of what medication needs to be taken, and HIPPA compliant chat with the doctor treating the patient.
