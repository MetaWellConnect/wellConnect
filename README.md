Overview
Category: Medical
* Story: WellConnect is a telehealth platform for doctors and patients to connect through. The aim of the platform is to provide an application for patients and doctors to set up meetings, text, ask questions before an appointment, and provide daily updates of a patient's well-being while a patient is under a doctor's care. This allows for patients and doctors to create more meaningful and trusting connections to further the human connection between doctors and patients.
* Market: Adults seeking medical help, especially young adults and medical practitioners
* Habit: This app is not to be used on a daily basis. It would be used on a monthly basis for a user to receive medical help.
* Scope: The scope of the project includes patients being able to complete intake forms before appointments, talk over in app text, and keep a doctor updated of their status. Doctors should be able to use the application to set up appointments with patients.
